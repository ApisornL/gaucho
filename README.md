Gaucho
===========================================

Gaucho is simply some Python scripts to access the 
[Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher)'s API to perform tasks which
I need to have executed through my deployment workflow.

At this point, it does not contain much but it might grow as I get more 
requirements.

Contributions are welcome if you want to use it and add to it.

## Usage
```
./services.py --help
```
